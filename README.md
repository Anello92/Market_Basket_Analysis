## 🧪 Analysis Workflow  

### 1. **Descriptive Insights**  
   - Understand purchase patterns through detailed visualizations.
   - Key analyses:  
     - **Most Ordered Products**  
     - **Reorder Rates by Department**  
     - **Peak Shopping Times (Day/Hour)**  

### 2. **Apriori Algorithm Implementation**  
   - Discover rules such as:  
     - _"If a customer buys bananas, they are likely to buy organic milk."_  
   - Fine-tune the algorithm using parameters:  
     - **Minimum Support**: Filter for frequent transactions.  
     - **Confidence Threshold**: Measure rule reliability.

### 3. **Metrics Interpretation**  
   - **Support**: Prevalence of individual/combined products in transactions.  
   - **Confidence**: Likelihood of Product B being purchased with Product A.  
   - **Lift**: Strength of association beyond random chance.

## 📊 Business Applications  
This analysis empowers retailers to:  
- Optimize product placement (e.g., "Beer & Diapers").  
- Build robust **recommendation systems** akin to Amazon's.  
- Forecast demand for better inventory management.  
- Enhance customer satisfaction by tailoring promotions.
